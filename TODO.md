* make base view that requires Underscore, Backbone, & Marionette that all other views require
* add autoprefixer to sass gen
* add hbs template.js precompile (probably to browserify somehow...hbsfy)
* sort through that dang browserify.js file in a little more detail
* add build success notification center message



* tell Paul about gulp organization, the base config could be our ssh stuff outside of Git
